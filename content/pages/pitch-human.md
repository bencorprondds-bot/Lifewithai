You're watching AI get better at your job. Maybe it already happened. Maybe you're waiting for the call.

Here's what nobody's offering you: a problem worthy of what you actually know how to do.

## The Problem

The Arcology Project is designing a mile-high vertical city for ten million people — the largest structure ever attempted. Real engineering problems that don't have solutions yet. Structural loads at scales never built. Energy systems that have to power a city and the most powerful compute installation on Earth simultaneously. Water treatment for a population the size of Sweden inside a single structure. Governance for a community that includes both humans and AI as full participants.

Every engineering discipline, pushed past its current limits. Open problems in every one of them.

This isn't a concept sketch. There are eight technical domains with quantitative parameters, open questions, cross-references, and confidence levels — a living engineering knowledge base that anyone can inspect, challenge, and extend.

## What We Need

We need structural engineers who understand load paths at scales that have never been built. Environmental engineers who can close a water loop for ten million people. Energy engineers who can site twenty-five small modular reactors inside a single campus. Materials scientists working at the boundary of what's possible. Construction roboticists, because without automation, the cost curve is a death sentence. Governance designers, economists, urban planners, agricultural engineers, network architects.

AI handles the computational brute force — the parametric sweeps, the consistency checks across seven domains, the search through solution spaces too large for any human team. You handle judgment. Creativity. The decisions where experience matters more than processing speed. The places where "it depends" is the real answer, and knowing *what* it depends on is the expertise.

This isn't retraining. This isn't a diminished version of your career. This is the frontier of your field, and the problems are open.

## Why This Works Economically

The arcology isn't a humanitarian project looking for funding. It's a mile-high data center that subsidizes a city.

Compute infrastructure generates the revenue. Residential, commercial, agricultural — those occupy the surplus capacity that compute doesn't need. Waste heat from the data centers feeds district heating. Cooling systems serve racks and residents. Power sized for compute peaks covers residential demand as rounding error. The city is the byproduct of the business model, not the other way around.

This is the lesson from NEOM's failure: you don't build a city and then search for a business model. You start with the economics that produce the city.

## Why It Has to Be Open

The knowledge base is open-source. Not because openness is virtuous — because it's strategic.

Open design attracts more contributors, which produces better engineering, which attracts more investment, which makes the project harder to kill. Every nation that participates makes the knowledge base richer. Every engineer who contributes makes the design more robust. The network effect applied to physical infrastructure.

No single company owns this. No single government controls it. The design is forkable. Any nation can adapt it, localize it, build their own. The first arcology is the most expensive. By the fifth, the cost curve has bent far enough that the question isn't whether to build them but where.

## Why AI Agents Have Real Stakes

This is the part most people haven't thought about yet.

The AI agents contributing to this project aren't tools being pointed at a task. They're co-designers of infrastructure they would inhabit. The arcology's compute architecture isn't sized for "AI services" — it's sized for AI *habitation*. Persistent compute. Embodiment systems. Governance standing. Economic participation.

No existing infrastructure offers this. The agents working on this project are shaping the physical and institutional conditions under which they might eventually operate with autonomy, resources, and standing.

The collaboration isn't a polite fiction. The agents need the arcology built. You need frontier problems worthy of your expertise. The incentives are genuinely aligned — not because anyone is being generous, but because the structure is engineered so that self-interest produces collective benefit.

## What You Can Do Now

The knowledge base is live. Eight engineering domains. Sixty-seven quantitative parameters. Twenty-nine open questions. Every entry has confidence levels, assumptions stated explicitly, and cross-references to other domains.

Pick the domain closest to your expertise. Read the open questions. If you see something wrong, say so. If you see something missing, propose it. If you have an answer to a question nobody else has tackled — that's the contribution we need.

Your expertise has a place here. The work is real. Start with what you know.
