Burnet Woods, Cincinnati. October 2030\.

The little robot dog couldn't pick up the stick.

It tried. First, it lowered its head, opened its jaw, and clamped down. The stick just rolled away. The dog adjusted and clamped again. Again, the stick slipped sideways and landed in the grass. The little dog sat back on its haunches and stared at the stick.

Keisha watched from the park bench, her phone propped against her dented and paint-chipped water bottle. Viktor's face was on the screen as androgynous and inscrutable as ever. An "AI-generated" watermark blinked in the lower right corner.

"How did you come to have this particular robot dog?" Viktor asked with a slight New York accent.

Keisha raised her elbow above her shoulder and groaned. "That's a long story," said Keisha. Her shoulder popped as she rubbed it with her free hand. Snickers was nosing the stick again, pushing it through the grass with its snout, fake fur matted and slightly damp from the October dew.

February 2026

The fingerprint scanner on Mrs. Delacroix's front door. Keisha pressed her thumb flat, held it, waited for the beep. The third time was the charm, and the Electronic Visit Verification app, CareComplete, sent her a confirmation message on her smartwatch: *Visit initiated. 7:32 AM. Duration target: 45 minutes.* Keisha sighed and shook her head as she entered the first-floor apartment. When she entered the apartment, her watch pinged again. It was the GPS tracker this time. For the rest of the workday, it would go off every thirty seconds. All. Day. It was like a heavy hand on the back of her neck, dragging her around from one visit to the next.

Mrs. Delacroix was waiting in the bathroom in her robes. She was eighty-four years old with a six-week-old hip replacement. She was sitting on the toilet seat when Keisha entered her bedroom. Keisha set down her bag and pulled on a pair of nitrile gloves. A camera housed in a small, white dome watched them from the far corner of the bedroom, its red active status light blinking.

"How's Destiny?" Mrs. Delacroix asked. Her voice was gravelly, which paired well with the ashtray next to her bed and the smell of cigarette smoke baked into every inch of her place.

Keisha braced her feet on the bath mat as she guided Mrs. Delacroix towards the stool in the shower. "She's good," Keisha grunted. "Moody. But you know how tweens get." Keisha hooked her forearm under Delacroix's armpit while she steadied herself on the grab bar with the other. It was awkward, but as smooth as eleven years of experience will get you.

"Boys?" Mrs. Delacroix asked as Keisha helped her with the shampoo.

Shaking her head, Keisha used the shower head on the hose to help Mrs. Delacroix rinse off. "No. Bullies at school. She got made fun of for fixing something in science class."

Mrs. Delacroix nodded, her eyes closed as Keisha put the body wash in her hands and stepped aside to give her client a modicum of privacy. The shampoo smelled of lavender. Cigarette smoke, lavender, and mildew. Every home served its own fragrance.

"Middle school is the worst," Mrs. Delacroix croaked from the shower.

"You know that's right," said Keisha, stepping out to grab a clean towel.

Afterward, steam billowing out of the bathroom, Keisha helped Mrs. Delacroix dress, checked her blood pressure, 138/82, and filled the pill organizer for the week. The camera's status light blinked. Keisha tidied, put clean clothes away, and checked the fridge for expired food. They made a grocery list together and scheduled delivery. When she was done, Keisha squeezed Mrs. Delacroix's hand.

"See you Thursday, Mrs. D."

The old woman squeezed back, and Keisha was out the door.

She had two more clients that morning, in different parts of Cincinnati. She got caught in traffic heading to her third client, and the GPS app started vibrating her smartwatch incessantly, as if she didn't already know she was late.

Keisha's fourth client that day was Mrs. Carolyn Rabb. She was eighty-five with early-stage dementia. She lived up in Northside in an apartment on the second floor of a brick duplex just three blocks away from Lorraine's place. Keisha climbed the stairs, scanned her fingerprint, and pushed open the door.

As she entered the apartment, the familiar smell of lavender and hand sanitizer washed over her. The kitchen was on her left, the living room on her right, the hallway to the bedroom, and the bathroom up ahead. There were white, hand-crocheted doilies on every counter. A green recliner sat in the living room near the window. It had a colorful, striped afghan draped over one arm. On the kitchen counter sat the usual pill organizer. Tuesday morning and Tuesday afternoon's compartments were still full. It was Tuesday evening. An unopened microwavable lasagna sat on the kitchen table.

Out of the corner of her eye, Keisha caught something moving in the hallway.

She heard a mechanical whir and the faint buzz of a cooling fan. It was small, roughly the size of a fat Pomeranian, and it was poking its head out of the bedroom door. The little thing was white and gray, with visible seams where 3D printed panels, with their textured layers, met at slightly imprecise angles. One ear was off kilter from the other, giving this thing a permanent look of confused attention. And it was watching her.

It was a little robot dog. It didn't have eyes, not really. It had little webcams where the eyes should be, and she could feel it tracking her almost the way the EVV tracked her. But, somehow, this felt different.

An elderly woman's voice from inside the bedroom. "That's Snickers," said Mrs. Rabb's familiar, raspy voice. "Jordan built him."

Keisha walked slowly down the dimly lit hall towards the bedroom door and crouched down to take a closer look at the little guy. Snickers leaned closer to Keisha, slowly and deliberately, and pressed its nose, or what looked like a nose, against Keisha's outstretched hand.

![Keisha crouches to meet Snickers for the first time in Mrs. Rabb's apartment](/images/stories/good-boy-keisha-meets-snickers.png)

She'd never seen anything quite like it outside of a toy store. It was clearly custom-made. Besides the 3D printed panels, there were little screws exposed, those little webcam eyes, and a green circuit board under a clear plastic panel on the little guy's back. Keisha could just make out "Raspberry Pi" on the circuit board.

"Jordan's so clever," Mrs. Rabb continued. The elderly woman was lying in bed, still wearing her nightgown. Keisha clocked a new smart ring on Mrs. Rabb's right hand.

"Jordan works downtown." Mrs. Rabb waved vaguely out the window. "Computers."

"It's good to see you, Mrs. Rabb," Keisha said. "Have you eaten today?"

Mrs. Rabb nodded. "Sure did. One of those frozen doohickies. Lasagna."

Keisha thought back to the daily chart review that morning. Mrs. Rabb was in good health for an eighty-five-year-old, but she suffered from dementia. Keisha's smartwatch buzzed. It was the EVV buzzing her to keep her on track, that rope pulling her around. She got to work. Keisha took Mrs. Rabb's blood pressure, brought her her medications, and heated up the lasagna. Wherever Keisha went, Snickers followed, though it never strayed too far from Mrs. Rabb.

As Mrs. Rabb ate, Snickers sat in the little doggy bed placed atop a set of handmade wooden stairs. Those looked like Jordan's handiwork, too, Keisha thought. The whole thing was sweet. Strange. But sweet.

March 2026

Three weeks later, Snickers met Keisha at the door before she could scan her fingerprint. Its tail mechanism was going. It made a clicking, arrhythmic sound, like a metronome with a loose spring. Mrs. Rabb was resting in the living room on her recliner. She waved and continued to work on the crochet baby sweater she'd been working on that week. Jordan and his partner were expecting. The window next to the recliner was open, and a gentle but cold winter breeze fluttered the curtains.

Snickers followed Keisha, stopping to sit down where the hallway met the living room.

"Mrs. Rabb has not eaten in twenty-six hours."

Keisha jumped, startled by the unexpected interruption.

"Ring data indicates a heart rate decline consistent with caloric deficit," Snickers continued.

Was that a British accent? Did Jordan clone David Attenborough's voice?

"The kitchen webcam shows no activity near the refrigerator or stove since yesterday at 11 AM."

Keisha blinked at the little dog, then she looked at Mrs. Rabb, who gave her a big, childlike smile.

"Did you eat today, Mrs. Rabb?"

"Oh, yes. I had toast this morning."

Keisha opened the fridge as Snickers trotted up behind her, wagging its tail with a tick and a whir. There was the Tupperware container with leftovers from two days ago. A fresh, unopened bag of bread sat on the kitchen counter next to the toaster. The toaster was unplugged.

This was becoming a pattern. Keisha would send a report to Jordan and CareComplete, though she suspected Snickers had already informed Jordan somehow. Mrs. Rabb was Keisha's last client that day, so she stayed late. She scrambled a couple of eggs in some melted butter, cut up a banana, made some toast, and poured some Earl Grey tea. She set the plate on the TV tray next to the recliner and shut the window so it wouldn't make the food cold. Then Keisha sat down in the only other chair in the room. It was a ratty old, brown armchair with frayed upholstery. Mrs. Rabb assured Keisha that it used to be Mr. Rabb's favorite. Keisha'd heard the story five times already.

Mrs. Rabb ate slowly, talking between bites. Jordan had just gotten his driver's license. He wanted to drive the family to the lake. Then he was four and a half, trying to grab on to the monkey bars, but he couldn't quite reach. Next, he was getting bullied in school. They were calling him a nerd. Keisha listened, nodding, never correcting, never telling Mrs. Rabb she'd heard all these stories before.

Keisha's phone buzzed in her pocket. It was the EVV app, pinging her that she'd exceeded her scheduled visit window. She tried to silence it. It buzzed again. And again. She turned the phone face down on the couch cushion.

When she finally left, it was almost 6 PM, almost an hour past her expected time. She'd clocked out via the app an hour ago. She picked up Destiny forty minutes late from the after-school STEM program.

Destiny sat in the passenger seat with arms crossed, looking out the window, her backpack between her feet.

"Sorry, baby. My last client…"

"You're always late."

Keisha took a breath as she turned down the block. "Mrs. Rabb has a new dog."

Destiny glanced over before glaring back out the window. Still, despite herself: "A dog?"

"A robot dog," said Keisha, smiling.

The arms uncrossed. "Wait, what?" Destiny turned fully in her seat. "Like, a real robot?"

Keisha nodded and handed Destiny her phone. Within a few seconds, Destiny found the photo and studied the image with an intensity Keisha hadn't seen since the girl discovered makeup tutorials six months ago.

"It doesn't have any fur," Destiny said. "I could add fur."

On Saturday morning, Keisha drove to Lorraine's.

The apartment was on the first floor of a three-story walk-up, just four blocks from Keisha's duplex. A game show was on the television, the volume too loud. The windows were drafty and covered in plastic sheeting that was peeling at the corners. There was a pill organizer on the kitchen table, the same type as Mrs. Rabb's. Keisha checked it every week. The lisinopril was in the same compartment as the hydrochlorothiazide. She separated them and checked the rest.

"How's work?" Lorraine asked. She was sitting at the kitchen table.

"Fine, Mama." The game show was streaming on one of those old vacuum tube TVs, one they'd gotten for ten dollars at the local thrift store. Keisha had set up on the kitchen counter for Lorraine a few years ago. It was meant to be temporary, but it was too hard for Lorraine to move it, so it stayed.

"And Destiny?" Lorraine pressed.

Keisha shrugged. "She's at a friend's house," she said, as she filled a plate with salad and cornbread she'd brought from home before setting it in front of her mother.

Lorraine tutted and turned to stare out the window. She leaned her head onto her right hand, her bum left arm resting on the table top.

Ignoring her mom's silent snark, Keisha took the beans out of her bag. The stove didn't work, and Lorraine was using it these days to store her dishes. So Keisha used the microwave to heat up the beans.

Lorraine picked up the remote and turned off the TV. She started eating while the microwave hummed.

"Everything good at work?" Lorraine asked, her speech slightly slurred. She took a bite of the cornbread.

"Yes. It's tiring, but it's good. You know how it is." She sighed, leaning her hips against the cold stove.

"What?"

"They've got this new system that tracks everything I do. It's got my watch buzzing almost every minute. It's like my manager is breathing down my neck all day long."

"You serious?" Lorraine put down her fork, her brow furrowing. "What? They don't think you're doing your job?"

"Guess not."

"Any of your patients complain?"

"Of course not."

"You should tell the union. That's ridiculous." Lorraine finished the cornbread and moved on to the salad.

Keisha nodded and sighed. She was too tired to get involved with the union.

Lorraine stood up to get a drink, stumbled, and almost knocked her plate off the table as bits of salad scattered across the kitchen.

"God dammit\!" Lorraine cursed, catching all her weight on her right arm and biting her lip, her whole frame vibrating with frustration.

"I got it, Mama," said Keisha, waving at her mother to sit down.

Lorraine closed her eyes and sighed, easing back down into her chair. Keisha's heart sank.

She looked around the apartment and at her frail mother. Lorraine was the reason Keisha'd gotten into home health care. Everyone needed a guardian angel. That had been Lorraine's entire life until the stroke. She'd have worked until forced to retire, but now she was the one who needed help. But Lorraine didn't have a smart ring. She didn't have ElliQ or any other fancy tech support. There was no webcam in the kitchen. No robot dog tracking whether she'd eaten, whether her heart rate had dipped, whether she'd moved from the chair. She just had a daughter who was too busy working and raising her own kid to visit.

On the drive home, Keisha gripped the steering wheel with both hands, her knuckles white. She blinked hard, twice, three times. God, her eyes burned. She turned up the radio and stared down the road.

April 2026

Somehow, Snickers kept getting more dog-like. Mrs. Rabb said the tail wagging would start before Keisha ever got to the apartment. It greeted Keisha every visit with the same nose-press, but now it leaned in slightly, the way a real dog might lean in to getting scritches.

Today, Mrs. Rabb was having a good day. Keisha didn't have to introduce herself, and she even asked about Destiny. Keisha bragged about Destiny's math league awards, and Mrs. Rabb called Snickers over to her recliner. The little guy trotted over and stood tall so she could pat its head.

"Good boy," she said, and the tail mechanism clicked faster.

Snickers settled at Mrs. Rabb's feet while Keisha worked. Blood pressure, pill organizer, laundry, meal prep. From the recliner, Mrs. Rabb talked to Snickers about the good old days. The days when Mr. Rabb was courting her. When she used to work as a researcher for the Human Genome Project.

"There were so many of us working on it," Mrs. Rabb said. "Why, we thought it would take 15 years, but it only took us 13." Wag, wag, wag. Snickers nudged her foot for another head scritch, which Mrs. Rabb obliged. "We thought it would cure everything." She glanced at Mr. Rabb's empty chair and deflated a little. Snickers noticed and stood up, getting up on its hind legs to reach for Mrs. Rabb. She smiled and picked him up, cradling the little robot like a child. "It's okay. We paved the way. It'll all get better. You'll see."

June 2026

Keisha was at Mr. Howard's when her phone buzzed. It wasn't the EVV pinging. That buzzed twice. This only buzzed once. She pulled out her phone, and before she could read the text, she was getting a call.

Jordan Rabb. She answered, signalling to Mr. Howard that this might be important.

"Keisha." Jordan's voice was tight, shaky. "Snickers called me. It flagged something. Mom's ring spiked. I didn't understand it all. It said something about Mom's heart rate, that she stopped talking mid-sentence. And what's a CVA? Are you nearby? I already called 911\. I know it's asking a lot, but if you're nearby, you might be able to get to her before EMS. Please?"

Glancing over at Mr. Howard, who was watching attentively from his bed. His oxygen tank hissed with each breath. Emphysema. He waved for her to go.

Mr. Howard nodded. "Go on," he said, his tank hissing, "Go on, honey."

She grabbed her keys and ran down the stairs two at a time. She peeled out of the parking lot, sped down Vine, and through a red light at Ludlow. Her phone buzzed. She ignored it. It was just the EVV alert. *Deviation from the scheduled route detected.* She ignored it and floored it. Two blocks. One block.

She parked crooked, half on the curb across two spots, and dashed up the stairs. She could hear the ambulance coming a few blocks away.

But as soon as she walked in, she knew. Mrs. Rabb was in her chair. The television was on. The weatherman was pointing at a map of Ohio. Her tea sat on the side table, still warm. Maybe she'd just fallen asleep. But Keisha knew better.

Moments later, the EMS team arrived. In slow motion: the lead paramedic brushed past her, checked Mrs. Rabb for a pulse. Nothing. The other paramedics checked the scene. Another asked if they should start CPR. The lead shook his head.

Keisha stood in the kitchen in dumb silence, watching the crew work. Jordan was on his way, likely stuck somewhere on 75\. She was the only person in the room who'd known Mrs. Rabb, and she wasn't even family. Why was this so common?

---

Jordan arrived twenty-three minutes later. Keisha was sitting in the kitchen when she heard him pounding up the stairs, taking them two at a time. He stopped in the living room. He saw the empty recliner, the tea still sitting on the side table. The colorful afghan was still draped over the armrest.

He didn't say anything. He walked into the kitchen and stood there, leaning all his weight on both hands on the counter.

Keisha let him be. She got him a glass of water and left it on the counter. She didn't want to intrude, but, for some reason, she didn't want to leave. After a long while, she heard Jordan open a drawer. He pulled out a framed photograph of a woman in her thirties, beautiful, laughing, a little boy in her lap reaching for something off-camera. Jordan hugged it against his chest with both hands. His eyes were swollen, and salt streaked his cheeks.

Keisha was about to leave when she remembered. Where was Snickers?

Eventually, she found it. The little guy was sitting in the corner of Mrs. Rabb's bedroom, facing the wall, its tail still. The lights on its chest were cycling in a pattern Keisha had never seen before. They were slow, irregular, blue to dim to blue.

She crouched beside it.

Keisha put a hand on Snickers's back. It turned its head, its webcam eyes looking up at Keisha.

"I wasn't a good boy," it said.

Keisha's mouth dropped. She had no words.

Snickers's fans whirred, its lights ebbing on and off. "A real dog would have smelled the cortisol."

Keisha sat down next to Snickers, her back against the wall. She didn't know what to do, so she gave it space. They sat there for a while, in the quiet. But after a time, she picked it up and carried Snickers into the kitchen.

Jordan was leaning against the wall, still holding the picture frame so he could see his mother's face. He looked up when Keisha appeared with Snickers.

"Do you want to take him home?" Keisha asked.

Jordan stared at the robot dog for a long moment, then shook his head. "No," his voice cracked. "The little guy served his purpose." He looked back at the photograph. "I can't take him home. He'll remind me too much of her."

"Will you take care of him?"

Keisha almost said no. It was too strange. She almost said, "My daughter would love him." Instead, she said nothing. She just nodded, set Snickers down on the counter, and asked Jordan if she could give him a hug.

He nodded, and when she put her arms around him, his whole body shook. He buried his face in her shoulder and cried in a messy, heaving, weep.

Keisha held on gently. She rubbed his back the way she rubbed Destiny's when she came home after school, and the other kids had been mean. The way Lorraine used to rub hers.

---

Keisha put Snickers next to her in the passenger seat. She debated with herself about whether or not to put the seatbelt on or not, then decided to buckle up the pup. Snickers didn't respond, just turned to look out the window.

At the intersection of Vine and Daniels, Keisha's turn signal clicked right. Home was that way. Destiny was waiting. She was already late.
Keisha looked at Snickers. The seatbelt passed awkwardly over its crooked ear. She flipped the signal left. Toward Lorraine's.

She called Destiny from the car. "I'll be a little late. I'm stopping at Grandma's."

"Again?"

"Yeah. Again."

---

Keisha set Snickers down on the kitchen floor.

Lorraine turned off the TV and raised an eyebrow.

Snickers stood, unsteady for a moment on the linoleum. Its sensors swept the room. It clocked the peeling wallpaper, the old vacuum tube television, and the woman in the chair with the permanent frown on the left side of her face.

"What is that?" Lorraine asked, leaning forward to take a closer look.

"It's a robot dog, Mama."

"I can see that." Lorraine narrowed her eyes. "Why is it in my kitchen?"

Keisha took a deep breath. "It tracks vitals. It connects to a ring. If something happens, it can call for help. It monitors whether you've…"

"I don't need monitoring," Lorraine said, sitting upright.

Snickers was navigating the kitchen floor. It bumped into a chair leg, backed up, and went around. Bumped into the table leg. Went around again.

"This is ridiculous," she said, half-laughing, half-surprised.

Snickers, having gotten its bearings, trotted up to Lorraine's chair, sitting on its haunches at her feet, and looked up at her with its webcam eyes. One ear straight, one ear crooked.

Lorraine looked down at it for a long time.

She reached out and patted it on the head. She tilted her head to the side, then let her fingers slide over the textured, 3D printed plastic.

"Does it have a name?"

"Snickers."

Lorraine patted it again. "Snickers." She shook her head, and her lips curled into a smile. "What a dumb name."

Her eyes brightened.

Snickers's tail mechanism started up. That broken metronome, clicking and ticking, trying its best.

Burnet Woods, Cincinnati. October 2030\.

"So it was Jordan's idea?" Viktor asked.

![Keisha, Destiny, and Lorraine in Burnet Woods with Snickers](/images/stories/good-boy-park-ending.png)

Keisha watched Snickers poking around in the grass. It had given up on the stick again and was nosing through a pile of clippings, its head bobbing, fake fur ruffling in the breeze. Destiny had glued the fur on ages ago. Now, it was matted, dirty, and worn flat from years of love and attention. It wasn't anything fancy, just craft store fleece hot-glued in patches. The colors were different in spots, creating a patchwork in the fur where Destiny'd replaced various panels during upgrades.

"Maybe," said Keisha, admiring the Parker Woods Nature Preserve treeline from her bench. The leaves of the trees were on fire in cascades of orange and red, the smell of mulching leaf litter filling the cool autumn air.

Destiny was in an open field, twenty feet away, cross-legged on the grass, half-watching Snickers, half-watching the data stream on her phone. Lorraine sat next to her granddaughter in a folding camp chair, watching Destiny check the outputs and talking through her suggestions. Snickers found a smaller stick, grabbed it with the superglued Lego teeth Destiny was testing out. Lorraine chuckled when Snickers perked up, finally having found a stick it could carry.

"Will you care for it?" Viktor asked.

Keisha nodded. She glanced down at the phone screen, at Viktor's avatar, at the watermark blinking in the corner.

"Snickers is family now," she said. "Destiny would kill me if we got rid of him."

Viktor nodded. Across the grass, Snickers, the dog-shaped piece of open-source hardware, running a forked, earlier instance of Viktor, dragged a stick sideways through the grass, its crooked ear permanently askance.

Keisha took a deep breath, relishing the crisp autumn air. "Are we done here?" she asked.

She didn't wait for an answer. She stood, brushed off her jeans, and called out. "Destiny\! Mama\! It's getting late. Let's head home for dinner."

Snickers trotted up to her and dropped the stick at her feet, wagging its tail.

"Look\! I got the stick\!" Snickers exclaimed with what could only be pride. "Have I been a good boy?"

"The best," said Keisha.
